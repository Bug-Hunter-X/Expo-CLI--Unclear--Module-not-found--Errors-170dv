The solution focuses on carefully reviewing all import statements for typos, ensuring the correct module paths and that all necessary dependencies are installed.

If using a package manager like npm or yarn, verify that all modules listed in `package.json` are properly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  Also clean the cache and restart the project.

Corrected Import:
```javascript
import { myFunction } from './myModule'; // Correct path and module name
```

If the problem persists, try these steps:

1. **Check for typos**: Double-check the spelling and capitalization of module names and paths in the import statement.
2. **Verify installation**: Run `expo install <module_name>` to install any missing dependencies.
3. **Clean the cache**:  Try `expo prebuild` or deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` folders and reinstalling dependencies.
4. **Restart the Expo Go app**: Close and reopen the Expo Go app on your device or simulator.
5. **Restart the development server**: Stop and restart the Expo development server.
