This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that doesn't exist or is not properly installed in your Expo project.  It can manifest in various ways, often related to asynchronous operations or incorrect file paths.  A common cause is a typo in the import statement or a missing dependency.  Another cause could be problems with the Expo Go app or the development environment, such as a cache issue.

Example:
```javascript
import { nonexistentFunction } from './nonexistentModule'; // nonexistentModule.js doesn't exist
```
